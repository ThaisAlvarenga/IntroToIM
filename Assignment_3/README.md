## Assignment 3

This program should be a game in which the player can control the spaceship with the up, down, left and right keys. A series of meteors will appear and the player
must try to avoid collision. When the player collides with a meteor, the meteor will look transparent. 

The size of the image is 400 pixels I belive. 

### Problem

Thought I don't increase the meteor image past its original size, it still appears blurry and gets blurrier. I tested the image without the movement and it worked 
fine. The problem seems to be actually resizing the image.
