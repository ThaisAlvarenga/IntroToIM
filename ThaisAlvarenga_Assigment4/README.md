# Description
This is a project that showcases the number of femicides committed in the country of Honduras since January 2021. It displays the number 
of cases by department (Honduran word for state) and the user can place the mouse on top of the bubbles containing the numbers to look at
the name of the department. Meanwhile, the map of Honduras can be seen forming in the background, with the bubbles placed on their 
respective location in the map. 

## Inspiration
To be honest, my original idea was to make something using generative text, however, I felt like I understood generative text better than
I did data visualization, so I decided to make the project based on data visualization to practice more. The idea of displaying the 
number of femicides committed in Honduras, my country since the start of 2020 came from I post I saw last week about a girl who was 
detained by the police at night and was discovered dead in her cell (most likely because she resisted an attempt to sexual assault by the
policemen who imprisoned her). The police took her to the hospital already dead, but filed in the report that she was taken alive and 
died while the doctors treated her and they refused to perform an autopsy, dismissing the case as a suicide attempt. The hospital, 
however, released their report in which they explained that she was strangled (most likely by men). Because of how boldly the police 
died, many people in the town where this happened started to make a campaign that grew into a social media under the hashtag 
usticeForKeyla (the name of the girl). Nevertheless, though the police has acknowledged that Keyla didn't commit suicide, they refused to
investigate. The policemen who incarcerated Keyla have been re-assign and their whereabouts are not known.

I was outraged by this case, not only because it was the police, the people charged with the safety of citizens, the ones who killed her
but also by the fact that they lied to openly about it. Femicide, unfortunately, is not something uncommon in my country and cases like
Keyla's are some of the few that are actually been investigated, if not by the police, by the Honduran people. It is very dangerous to
be a women in Honduras and in honor of the 90% of the victims that will not receive justice for their murder, I decided to make this 
visualization.
