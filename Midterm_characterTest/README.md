The problem I have is the posX and posY values of the player. When I print them, they do not give the posiition of the sprite. I thought
the problem might be due to the scale() I use to resize the sprite, but even when I commented it out, the values of the position were 
still off. I also have another question: once I fix that problem, I would still have to scale the sprite, which would mess up the values
again. How could I go about solving that?

I am attching below the way I was thinking to detect the walls of the maze
